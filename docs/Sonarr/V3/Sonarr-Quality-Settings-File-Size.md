# Quality Settings (File Size)

I often get the question what's the best Quality Settings  to use,
Well it's actually person preference so I will show you a recommended Quality Settings.
But before you continue to read, as with all my guides:

!!! question ""
    **If you don't care about quality then stop reading and see if the other tutorials are helpful for you.**

This Quality Settings has been created and tested with info I got from others and release comparisons from different sources,
I only do WEB-DL my self for TV shows because in my opinion WEB-DL is the sweet spot between Quality and Size and you often don't see big difference anyway for TV shows. (Except for shows like GOT, Vikings, etc)

## Q&A

Q: Why do you only show starting from HDTV720p?

A: With the big screens these days anything lower doesn't look watchable

Q: Why do you have some sized set so high?

A: You probably didn't read the bold text above, I also need to keep in mind usenet releases that are often bigger then torrent releases.

Q: You noticed that some shows don't grab because of these settings.

A: If you notice  you can provide me a proof with a screenshot and the error it shows you when you do a interactive search.
But I will only accept changes that are International releases no multi, or dubbed language releases, I won't accept mislabeled source releases like from MeGusta, etc (they should learn to name their stuff decent first). I won't accept changes for micro sized releases.
