#### Create the channels

<div class="indent-L1 indent-B1">
First thing to do is create a few channels where you receive your notifications.

!!! note:
    I won't be explaining how to setup a discord channel, that's up to you but google has plenty of references.

You can do it all from one channel or separate the notifications (granular) for each trigger if you want.
</div>

#### Simple channel setup

`#media` => All the `*arr` notifications you setup in [Notification Settings](#notification-settings).

`#errors` => Health checks, network errors, etc.

`#plex` => Play, resume, etc. for Plex.

After you create the needed channels, it's time to add them to the `Setup the channels`

First we need to get the channel ID's from your server/channel

Open your User Settings -> Appearance -> Enable Developer Mode.

 ![image-20201107201431508](images/image-20201107201431508.png)

 Right click on the Discord text channel you want the bot to interact  with and press "Copy ID"

 ![image-20201107201209441](images/image-20201107201209441.png)

Paste the channel ID in the corresponding boxes.

 ![image-20201107201822743](images/image-20201107201822743.png)

1. Add the channel ID for the `#media` channel.
1. Add the channel ID for the `#errors` channel.
1. Add the channel ID for the `#plex` channel.
1. Use this option if you want to use separate channels for the notifications (see below).

     You have to be an administrator of the Discord channel to invite bots. Make sure the bot has permissions to post.

??? summary "Bot Setup Help"
    Right click on your server > Server Settings > Roles

    If you have a Bot role you can skip this, otherwise click the + next to ROLES

    Name the role Bot and scroll down to Text Permissions.

    Enable `Send Messages`, `Embed Links` & `Add Reactions`

    Go back to your server, right click on the Media Bot and assign the role of Bot

#### Reactions

Here we will setup the Discord Notifier reactions(emoji's) that will be shown during a playback in plex, or during a download/import in Sonarr/Radarr.

![image-20201108084938027](images/image-20201108084938027.png) ![image-20201108085034607](images/image-20201108085034607.png)

This section exist of 2 parts.

1. *arr state (grab/failed) and play state of plex.
1. The Trackers/Indexers.

First we're going to download the emoji's and you can do that in 2 ways.

1. 1 at a time - Right click -> Save As... - for these emoji images to some location on your computer.
1. Pack Download - Click [here](https://discordnotifier.com/setup.php?grab=reactions){:target="_blank"} to download a zip of all the current reaction images.

For this example, we will be using Pack Download.  You'll need download the file and then unpack it somewhere on your computer.  After which, you can then add the emoji's to your Discord Server easily.

How to add your own Emoji's => [LINK](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360036479811-Custom-Emojis){:target="_blank"}

After you've added them to your Discord Server it's time to get the ID's from your emoji's, to do this go in to one of your channels and type:

```bash
\:emoji_name:
```

??? example "Example"
    ![image-20201108092738752](images/image-20201108092738752.png)

    What results in to.

    ![image-20201108092827192](images/image-20201108092827192.png)

    So your ID would be `:grab:706535455876710461`.

Paste the ID results from your channel in to the corresponding boxes.

 ![image-20201108093201236](images/image-20201108093201236.png)

Do this for all the other boxes also including your Trackers/Indexers.

#### Trackers and Indexers

 ![image-20201108093947565](images/image-20201108093947565.png)

1. Paste here the the emoji ID.
1. The actual indexer name you're using in Sonarr/Radarr.

??? example "Example"

    ![image-20201108094627415](images/image-20201108094627415.png)

    What will result in to.

    ![image-20201108094834791](images/image-20201108094834791.png)

    If you use a different name in Sonarr and Radarr just add them with a comma `BeyondHD - Jackett,BHD`.

Don't forget to click on `Save Changes` !!!

!!! note
    After pasting the Emoji's ID in to the box you will notice that the leading colon will disappear nothing to worry about that's per design
