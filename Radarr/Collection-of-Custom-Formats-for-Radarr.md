#### x265
![](images/image-20200307121406542.png)

> x265 = `C_RX_(X|H)\.?265`
>
> If you prefer x265 releases (Encodes/Re-Encodes).
> Why HEVC isn't added in this CF ?
> HEVC is officially only used for untouched sources, but most x265 Encoders/Re-Encoders mix them in the release name because they don't know better or think they do.
> I didn't add it because this would also mean that BR-DISK/Remux is a x265 and those are untouched sources so never are x265.
> Luckily most x265 Encoders/Re-Encoders also add x265 so it get's picked up correctly.

>If you prefer Dolby Vision Video's you now can use Single layer Dolby Vision what seems to works in Plex on the Shield.... The Double layer's only tend to work on smart tv's.

>To make this workable you need to check this in your profile and put it on top of the others you got !!!
